## Description

Personally, I’m fascinated by sports. However I’ve never made a website or app about the thing I love… This is my time to shine! 

When I heard about this project I immediately started searching for APIs. I finally found a free NBA API. Within this API I get to fetch all sorts of data, I’ll show this data on the screen dynamically.

This app will show the following data:
- previous played games   
- Current NBA Teams 
- Players per team


Getting interested? Take a look!

## API
This API contains information about the most popular basketball league, the NBA. Within this API there is a lot of data. Data from each player, data from each team and data from each game. 

There are more APIs who can get this data but most of them aren’t free. This one is!
