## Description

Personally, I’m fascinated by sports. However I’ve never made a website or app about the thing I love… This is my time to shine! 

When I heard about this project I immediately started searching for APIs. I finally found a free NBA API. Within this API I get to fetch all sorts of data, I’ll show this data on the screen dynamically.

This app will show the following data:
- previous played games   
- Current NBA Teams 
- Players per team


Getting interested? Take a look!
